content: "There are many different ways to style code with GitHub's markdown. If
  you have inline code blocks, wrap them in backticks: `var example = true`.  If
  you've got a longer block of code, you can indent with four spaces:\r

  \r

  \    if (isAwesome){\r

  \      return true\r

  \    }\r

  \r

  GitHub also supports something called code fencing, which allows for
  multiple lines without indentation:\r

  \r

  ```\r

  if (isAwesome){\r

  \  return true\r

  }\r

  ```\r

  \r

  And if you'd like to use syntax highlighting, include the language:\r

  \r

  ```javascript\r

  if (isAwesome){\r

  \  return true\r

  }\r

  ```"
